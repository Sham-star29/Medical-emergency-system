# Medical emergency system
In areas that do not enjoy easy access to a medical facility, the timely availability of diagnosis and medication is an issue of great importance. This project introduces a prototype for a patient kiosk that will be able to diagnose an individual's health in public places, such as pharmacies, shopping malls, transportation hubs, and along highways. The system tends to offer temporary relief by providing preliminary health assessment, therefore increasing the prospect of a person resisting medical withdrawal before consulting a doctor. Once the health check-up is completed, the machine provides prescription medication to the user's registered mobile phone number. In conditions of critical symptoms, it advises immediate medical consultation. Secure storage of patient health history in the cloud is also performed by the system for future treatments. This approach tries to improve access to healthcare, especially in rural and underserved communities, by solving the gap that exists from diagnosis to professional medical care.
